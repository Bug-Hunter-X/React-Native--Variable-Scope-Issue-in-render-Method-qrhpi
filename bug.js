This error occurs when you try to use a variable declared inside a component's render method outside of that method.  In React Native, the render method is called every time the component updates.  Variables declared within it are re-created with each render, so they don't retain their values between renders.

```javascript
// Bug: Incorrect state update
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    let counter = 0; // Declared in render, lost each render
    counter++;
    return (
      <Text>Counter: {counter}</Text>
    );
  }
}
```
